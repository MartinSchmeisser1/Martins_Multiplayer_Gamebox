# Martins Multiplayer Gamebox
A collection of Multiplayer-Minigames for Couch-Coop.
This is currently developed for a PC/Steamdeck with 1-4 XBOX-Controllers connected.

I have no idea how much time I will invest in this project, but I hate the lack of couch-koop games nowadays and it would be great to have a collection of minigames.
I am also thinking about implementing a larger couch-coop game in the future. 

## Participation
If you have any interest in participating (extending games, improve design, adding new games), feel free to contact me.
For Game-Development, knowledge about Unity and C# is needed.
Design-Stuff could be done in Adobe Illustrator, Blender or maybe also Photoshop.
All games in this collection will be for sure in 2D, so no 3D-modelling needed.
